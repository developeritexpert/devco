              description: `Cognitive computing is a family of different technologies designed to “think” in ways similar to the human brain; with the right processing models, your app or platform can analyze data, make predictions, automate tasks, and produce ongoing optimizations.
              <br></br>
              Artificial intelligence (AI) is a science, much like mathematics or physics, which focuses on the construction of “intelligent” machines that can creatively solve problems/machine learning models. Machine learning (ML data scientists) is a subfield of AI that relies on algorithms that automatically “learn” and make improvements based on past experiences by machine learning engineer.
              <br></br>
              For example, an algorithm may gradually learn to identify which images contain cats based on feedback on prior guesses. There’s also deep learning, a type of machine learning, which relies on neural networks that mirror the architecture of the human brain.
              <br></br>
              With cognitive computing, you can create better products for your customers, learn more from your organization’s data, improve productivity, and refine how your business operates—it all depends on how you choose to develop it.`,

                    question: "What is the process of e-commerce development?",
                    answer: `The process of ecommerce development can vary depending on the needs and requirements of the business. However, in general, the process will involve the following steps: 1. Planning and Analysis – In this stage, the ecommerce developer will work with the client to map out the requirements and goals of the project. They will also analyze the existing website or system to determine what needs to be changed or updated. 2. Design – Once the requirements have been finalized, the ecommerce developer will create a design for the new website or system. This design will be based on the goals and needs of the client, as well as industry best practices. 3. Development – Once the design is finalized, the ecommerce developer will begin to code and build the new website or system. They will work closely with the client to ensure that all requirements are met. 4. Testing – Once the development phase is complete, the ecommerce developer will test the website or system to ensure that it is functioning properly. They will also test for any compatibility issues with existing systems or software. 5. Launch – Once all testing is complete, the ecommerce developer will launch the new website or system. They will provide training and support to help get your business up and running smoothly. – What are the benefits of ecommerce development?`,

                    question: "What is the difference between ecommerce web development and website design?",
                    answer: `Ecommerce development and ecommerce design are two important aspects of online stores. However, they are often confused with one another. So, what is the difference between ecommerce development and ecommerce design? Ecommerce development is the process of creating a custom ecommerce system or website. This involves coding and building the site, as well as testing it for functionality and compatibility. Website design is the process of creating a visually appealing website that meets the needs of the client. This typically involves choosing a template or design, and then customizing it to match the needs of the business. So, which one is more important? In general, ecommerce development is more important than ecommerce design. This is because the development phase is responsible for creating a functional website or system that meets all the requirements of the client. The design phase can help make the website or system look nicer, but it is not as essential as the development phase.`,
