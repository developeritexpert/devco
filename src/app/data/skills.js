                    description: "With Android, you don’t have to worry about any of the stringent approval processes that other platforms require in order to take an app to market. This speeds up the development cycle and allows you to go from concept to product in a fraction of the time.<br>However, the Android app approval process can sometimes be a challenging one for developers. In order to get an Android app approved in the Google Play Store, you must first create a Google Play Developer account. This account costs $25 per year, and there is also a $100 one-time fee for publishing your application.<br>Once you have created a Google Play Developer account, you must submit your application for review. Your application will be reviewed by Google's team of reviewers, and they will determine whether or not it is approved for publication.<br>The review process can be difficult and time consuming. Google's team of reviewers will check your application for compliance with their guidelines, and they may ask you to make changes to your application before it is approved. If your application does not comply with Google's guidelines, then it may be rejected.<br>The good news is that Google has recently made the review process easier for developers. They have introduced a new program called Developer Preview, which allows developers to release their applications without waiting for approval from Google's team of reviewers. This program is still in beta, so it may have some bugs, but it is a great way to test your application before submitting it for review.",
