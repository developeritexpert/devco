                    description: "More than 57% of people search for content using a mobile device and in 2018, 63% of all paid Google search clicks originated from a mobile device. If your website isn't mobile-friendly and doesn't perform like most mobile apps, you're losing the majority of your leads that come from smaller screen sizes. So, how do web development companies like DEV.co make their clients' websites mobile-friendly? One way is by using responsive design. With responsive design, the layout of a website can change depending on the size of the screen it is being viewed on. This means that no matter what device you are using, you will always have a clear and easy-to-use website. Another way we create mobile-friendly is by using adaptive web design. With adaptive design, the layout of a website changes depending on the type of device it is being viewed on. For example, if a website is being viewed on a phone, the layout will be different than if it is being viewed on a laptop. This ensures that all users have the best possible experience when visiting your website. So, which approach should you use for your website? It really depends on your needs and budget. However, both responsive design and adaptive design are great ways to make your website mobile-friendly. We're not just a custom software development company, but we are one of the best mobile app development companies on the market as well.",

High-performing sites use SSL to encrypt data like credit card numbers, email addresses, and personal information to make visitors feel confident and secure. But our cybersecurity in web development is more than just an SSL. We offer government level security encryption, for web apps that require higher security measures. As web developers, we are responsible for ensuring the security of data transmission on our client web projects. We take into account a variety of factors, such as the type of data being transmitted, the level of security required, and the environment in which the data will be used. Data can be classified into two categories: sensitive and nonsensitive. Sensitive data is any information that could potentially cause harm if it were to fall into the wrong hands. Nonsensitive data is less sensitive and doesn't pose as much of a risk if it were to be leaked. When it comes to securing data, we take a layered approach. This means using a variety of security measures to protect data at every stage of its life cycle. Some common security measures include: password protection, encryption, firewalls, antivirus software, and data loss prevention (DLP) software Web developers also need to be aware of the different types of attacks that can be launched against their websites. Some common attacks include: SQL injection Cross-site scripting Phishing attacks Malware attacks DEV.co's web development agency can help secure your web project with an experienced web development services team and comprehensive security solutions.",

A slow-loading website can frustrate users and cause them to leave before they even have a chance to see what your website has to offer. When your conversion rate takes a dive, so does your revenue. Some experts estimate that slow-loading websites cause retailers across the country to lose $2.6 billion in sales every year. We focus on Core Web Vitals (CWV) to ensure your web app loads smoothly without interruption. Here are a few ways we can help make your website load faster: 1. Use a web hosting service provider that is optimized for site speed 2. Use a caching plugin to store a copy of your website's pages in the visitor's browser 3. Minimize the use of images and videos on your website 4. Make sure all of your files are properly compressed 5. Use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve your website's files from multiple servers around the world 6. Optimize your website's code for faster loading times 7.
